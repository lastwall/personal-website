                    Hi, my name is <b>Saeid Hassanpour</b>. I was born in Iran/Gilan. 
                    I have got my Bachelor's degree in computer engineering at the Karaj PNU university. 
                    I've started programming when I was in high school, at the moment I am engaged with <b>PHP</b>, and started working as a Freelancer, and later on I've worked with many companies inside and outside of country. 
                    So still I love programming <b>PHP</b>. 
                    I'm always eager to exploring tech-related stuff so I've tried to learn as much as I can. 
                    I've expanded my knowledge more in many aspects.<br></br>
                    Currently working on my <b>JS</b> skills in both Backend &amp; Frontend which drives me to work on <b>Node.js,</b> <b>Next.js, React </b>with <b>Tailwindcss</b> and <b>Chakra-ui</b>.
            </p>
